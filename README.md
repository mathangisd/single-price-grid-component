## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge helped me get a good understanding of css grid and flexbox properties. I used pixel perfect to match it closely with the design.

### Continued-Development
I would like to work on projects with different layouts and focus on making them responsive.
